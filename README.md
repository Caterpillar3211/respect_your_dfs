# Respect your dataframes!

This is work-in-progress. This library will contain classes and methods that will help to clean-up your ML code written using sklearn library.

The library is structured similiary to sklearn, each and every class contains fit, transform and fit_transform methods. Parameters are selected during object creation, and can later be changed with unique methods.

Note that most of these are just wrappers around sklearn objects.
